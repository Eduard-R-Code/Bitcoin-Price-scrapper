# Bitcoin Price - Scrapper

This is a Bitcoin price scrapper, which interogates the current price of Bitcoin. 
It reports how the price moved (green if it went up, and red if it went down), since the last time the script has been oppened. 



## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install a few packages.

```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

## Future Development

Make a drop-down menu allowing the user to check the price on multiple cryptocurrencies.
Install a sound alarm triggered by a certain amount desired by user.
